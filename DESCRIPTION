Description: A comprehensive suite of functions for 
  analyzing genetic data obtained from pooled samples. This package can read in 
  Fragment Analysis output (fsa) files, process the data, and score peaks, as 
  well asfacilitate various analyses, including cluster analysis, calculation 
  of genetic distances and diversity indices, as well as bootstrap resampling 
  for statistical inference. Specifically tailored to handle genetic data 
  efficiently, researchers can explore population structure, genetic 
  differentiation, and genetic relatedness among samples.
