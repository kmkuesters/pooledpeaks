Description: Pooledpeaks provides a comprehensive suite of functions for 
  analyzing genetic data obtained from pooled samples. This package can read in 
  fsa files, preprocess the data, and score peaks, as well as facilitate various 
  analyses, including cluster analysis, calculation of genetic distances and 
  diversity indices, as well as bootstrap resampling for statistical inference. 
  Specifically tailored to handle genetic data efficiently, researchers can 
  explore population structure, genetic differentiation, and genetic relatedness 
  among samples.
