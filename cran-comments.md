## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

*Addressed the data_manipulation note from the previous submission.

*Addressed the comments from my previous submission regarding references, the 
  use of dontrun, redundant language in the description, switching from using
  print and cat to message and warning, removing default path in writing 
  functions R/score_marker_wrap.R, switching to suppressWarnings, and not 
  changing user environment.
  
*Added contributor information
