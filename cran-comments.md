## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

*Addressed the data_manipulation note from the previous submission.

*I checked the DESCRIPTION for spelling errors and have removed the previously 
  noted "pre"; however "fsa" is the type of file format that the package can 
  read in and is the correct spelling.

*I have tried to simplify the examples that were taking more than 5 seconds 
  but it does just take time.
